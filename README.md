## Description
---
In this project, we aim to create an NFT marketplace for the auction of digital assets using smart contracts and solidity.

## Goals
---
In recent years, there has been an ever increasing interest in NFTs, both in terms of ownership and exchange. Our goal is to build a platform that aims to provide a user friendly and efficient solution to this domain of Fintech. It provides:

* Platform to connect NFT collectors with custom artwork peices that may interest them
* Ability to place bids for the items over a decentralized network in cryptocurrency
* Trace of ownership and re-sale history of each peice of work
* Provide a secure file storage (ipfs versus http) to maintain repositroy and owndership/event history

## Data Collection and Preparation
---

In order to test and demo our application we need to have an inventory of digital artwork. We created some custom ones using Photoshop. In order to generate the IPFS links for the custom artwork, we utilized OpenSea.

## Development and Technologies
---

Our NFT marketplace is build using the following technologies: 
* Solidity (smart contracts)
* Remix IDE
* Streamlit (front-end)
* MetaMask (wallet)
* Decentralized Blockchain Network (Polygon TestNet)
* Xbox GameBar/Quicktime Player (Demo Video)
* New tech/library (not covered in class to be updated??)
* Opensea
* Photoshop
